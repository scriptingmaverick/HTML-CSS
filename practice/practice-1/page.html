    <h1>The Quiet Decline of the Wooden
      Pencil
    </h1>
    <p>For more than a century, the wooden pencil was one of the most widely used tools in
      education, design, and everyday writing. Today, it survives mostly through habit, nostalgia,
      and a few specialized industries.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="tool-div">
    <h2>A Tool Once Everywhere</h2>
    <p>The wooden pencil was once a universal object. Schools ordered them by the thousands,
      offices kept boxes in drawers, and artists relied on them for sketching and drafting. Their
      appeal was simple: inexpensive, reliable, and easy to replace.</p>
    <p>Manufacturing processes became highly optimized during the twentieth century. Cedar
      wood, graphite mixtures, and lacquer coatings were refined into a predictable industrial
      product that could be produced at enormous scale with minimal variation.</p>
    <p>For decades, the pencil represented a balance between permanence and flexibility. Marks
      could be erased, notes revised, and mistakes corrected without consequence.</p>
    <div id="inline-box">
      <h2>Changing Habits</h2>
      <div class="inline-div">
        <h3>The rise of digital writing
        </h3>
        <p>The most significant change came not from improvements in competing writing
          tools but from the disappearance of handwriting itself. As computers and mobile
          devices became primary tools for communication, the situations that required
          pencils quietly diminished.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="inline-div">
        <h3>Disposable alternatives
        </h3>
        <p>Mechanical pencils and inexpensive ballpoint pens replaced many traditional use
          cases. These alternatives removed the need for sharpening and reduced
          maintenance, appealing to environments focused on convenience rather than
          longevity.</p>
        <p>Even in classrooms, tablets and laptops gradually replaced handwritten
          assignments, reducing bulk demand that once sustained large-scale pencil
          production.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="industry-div">
    <h2>An Industry Adjusts</h2>
    <p>Pencil manufacturers responded by shifting toward specialty markets. Premium pencils,
      artist-grade graphite, and collectible editions emerged as companies attempted to
      differentiate themselves from cheaper imports and declining volume sales.

    </p>
    <p>Some brands emphasized craftsmanship and heritage, highlighting traditional
      manufacturing techniques and sustainable wood sourcing. Others diversified into office
      supplies or art materials to maintain revenue.</p>
    <p>A few manufacturers even leaned into nostalgia, marketing pencils as objects associated
      with focus and slower, more deliberate thinking. Articles discussing analog tools and
      attention often reference the pencil as a symbol of simplicity, such as long-form writing
      movements that encourage distraction-free work.</p>

  </div>

  <div id="appeal-div">
    <h3>A Persistent Appeal</h3>
    <p>Despite declining demand, the wooden pencil has not disappeared. Its tactile feedback,
      erasability, and low cost continue to make it valuable in early education, sketching, and
      environments where technology is impractical.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="nostalgia-div">
    <h2>More Than Nostalgia</h2>
    <p>The decline of the pencil industry reflects a broader shift in how people interact with tools.
      Objects once designed for daily physical use are increasingly replaced by digital
      equivalents that prioritize speed and convenience.
    </p>
    <p>Yet the pencil remains a reminder that not all efficiency is technological. Sometimes the
      appeal of a tool lies in its limitations, encouraging slower thinking and intentional work
      rather than constant revision.</p>
    <p>Whether the wooden pencil becomes a niche artifact or finds renewed relevance will
      depend less on manufacturing innovation and more on how people choose to write, learn, and create in the future.
